To run DTBot, you require:

 * PHP 5.3+

 * Lua Runtime

 * Lua PECL extension for PHP


Optional requirements:

 * Some SQL or No-SQL database. If you run something different than MySQL, MariaDB
   or any MySQL-like database, you will have to figure out a way to connect to
   it from Lua.

 * Cookies (the chocolate chips ones).
